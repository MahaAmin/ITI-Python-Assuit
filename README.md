what is a README file ?
A README file is a text file (commonly readme.txt) that contains information for the user 
about the software program, utility, or game. README files often contain instructions and 
additional help, and details about patches or updates.

* .md extension comes from a word: markdown. It's a markup language for text

If you have used GitHub you might have noticed the importance of a Readme file. For those who are unfamiliar, it is the a markdown or a text file whose contents are rendered automatically by GitHub. A Readme file at the root folder of your repo will contain the information that is shown when a user visits your repo

About READMEs:
You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, 
what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.

You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. 
A README, along with a repository license, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, 
communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.

A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. 
README files typically include information on:

- What the project does
- Why the project is useful
- How users can get started with the project
- Where users can get help with your project
- Who maintains and contributes to the project

If you put your README file in your repository's root, docs, or hidden .github directory, 
GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.


** Writing a good README:

* Make sure the file always includes the following elements:

    Titles and internal titles:
        A title should explain clearly what we have here, and it's usually a project's name - a H1 heading prefaced with #. If a project's name doesn't disclose its content, still it's worth to suggest what it is.
        =========================================
    Introduction - the project's aim:
        Introduction is like a summary. It shouldn't be too long as we don't want to read an essay on a project. We should describe in an interesting manner what's the project aim, and what problems does a given application solve. Two or three sentences are enough in case of a small project.
        =========================================
    Technologies:
        Let's write down the languages we used, the libraries and its versions.
        =========================================
    Launch:
        How to run a project? Does a project has minimum hardware requirements?
        =========================================
    
* Consider also using additional elements such as: 

    - Table of contents
    - Illustrations
    - Scope of functionalities 
    - Examples of use
    - Project status 
    - Sources
    - Other information
